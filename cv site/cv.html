<ul>
<li> Set up a server and client application then tested it on my command prompt to ensure that it was 
running successfully.</li>
    <li>Aided by doing a pitch about pwc Cybersecurity services to a company called Boldi AG that was 
looking for top consultancies to help them strengthen their Cyber security.</li>
    <li> Had to differentiate due care from due diligence for information risk management. Afterwards, use my 
knowledge to analyse what Boldi AG did wrong in their security systems and explain if it was due 
care, due diligence or both.</li>
    <li>Explained, based on the key principles of defense, the basic options that Boldi AG have for limiting or 
containing damage from risk.</li>
    <li>Created a PowerPoint slide on how Boldi AG can react to a cyber-attack experienced by their 
competitor.</li>
    <li> Sent a voicemail to my co-worker Stefan on how an agenda differs based on the audience, e.g. 
management vs engineers?</li>
    <li>Discovered that Boldi AG files on paper and the company’s cloud-based information systems are 
inconsistent in format and hard to use for an analysis.</li>
    <li>Gathered enough information about Boldi AG, to decide what type of risk assessment would be best, 
a quantitative risk assessment or a qualitative risk assessment and came to the conclusion that 
quantitative risk assessment will be better for Boldi AG.</li>
    <li>Then I explained the difference between quantitative and qualitative assessments.</li>
    <li>Expanded my knowledge on vulnerability assessment, mitigation planning, vulnerability scanning, 
hardware and systems security, information systems security baseline and explain why an up-to-date 
Information System Security Baseline is crucial.</li>
    <li>Created a graphic using the above terms, so it could be presented to the Head of IT Infrastructure for 
Boldi AG and I explained the relationship between the terms.</li>
    <li>Wrote a detailed explanation how segmentation contributes to network security and to the security of 
the whole organisation.</li>
    <li>Added notes on how firewalls A-DMZ, B-Admin Zone, C-Client Zone and D-Server Zone at Boldi AG 
need to be configured using the concepts of whitelisting and blacklisting and why.</li>
